# Terraform Github Actions - Data Engineering

This is a use case of Github Actions for a simple Terraform-AWS deployment. The plan is to build this to a full-flegded application. For now, we are creating a budget and creating an S3 bucket for our AWS account, we can then move to create more S3 buckets, EC2s, deploy application containers on our EC2s.
